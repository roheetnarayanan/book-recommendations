# Book Recommendations
Built a book recommendation system using NLP. The datasets are a set of books from "Charles Darwin". A TF-IDF Model was built using bad of words of the books which were tokenized and stemmed. Using the Tf-idf scores, a similarity matrix was create to find the most similar books to "Descent of Man". The recommendations is also visualized using a cluster map(based on thier similiarities).
